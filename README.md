# Scalable Web Application Architecture using AWS Services

## Project Overview
This project implements a scalable web application using AWS services. The application handles user registration, authentication, image upload, and viewing functionalities.

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: Hosted on Amazon S3, delivered via Amazon CloudFront.
- **Backend**: Implemented using AWS Lambda, exposed via Amazon API Gateway.
- **User Management**: Handled by Amazon Cognito.
- **Image Storage**: Amazon S3.
- **Database**: Amazon RDS (Aurora) for storing user data and image metadata.

## AWS Services Used
1. **Amazon Cognito**: For user registration and authentication.
2. **Amazon S3**: For static website hosting and image storage.
3. **Amazon RDS (Aurora)**: For relational database storage.
4. **AWS Lambda**: For serverless backend logic.
5. **Amazon API Gateway**: For exposing backend APIs.
6. **Amazon CloudFront**: For CDN and global content distribution.
7. **AWS IAM**: For access management.
8. **AWS WAF and AWS Shield**: For security.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Setup Infrastructure
1. Create an S3 bucket for static website hosting and image storage.
2. Set up Amazon CloudFront distribution for the S3 bucket.
3. Configure Amazon RDS (Aurora) instance for user and image metadata storage.

### Phase 2: User Management
1. Configure Amazon Cognito for user registration and authentication.
2. Set up user pools, identity pools, and configure policies for access control.

### Phase 3: Backend Logic
1. Create AWS Lambda functions for user registration, authentication, image upload, and retrieval.
2. Set up Amazon API Gateway to expose Lambda functions as RESTful APIs.

### Phase 4: Frontend Development
1. Develop frontend application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for user registration, login, image upload, and viewing.
2. Host the frontend application on S3 and configure CloudFront for global distribution.

### Phase 5: Security and Optimization
1. Implement IAM roles and policies for secure access to AWS resources.
2. Set up AWS WAF and AWS Shield for application protection.
3. Optimize Lambda functions and API Gateway for performance and cost efficiency.

### Phase 6: Testing and Deployment
1. Perform end-to-end testing of the entire application.
2. Monitor application performance and adjust resources as needed.
3. Deploy the application to production.

## Security Measures
- Secure access using IAM roles and policies.
- Protect against web exploits with AWS WAF.
- Enable DDoS protection with AWS Shield.
- Encrypt data at rest using AWS KMS.

## Scalability and Availability
- Auto-scaling with Lambda.
- High availability with Amazon Aurora.
- Global distribution with CloudFront.

## Interaction Flow
User Access:
Users access the application via a domain name managed by Amazon Route 53.
Traffic is directed to Amazon CloudFront for content delivery.

Frontend Delivery:
CloudFront serves the static website content hosted in Amazon S3.
CloudFront caches static assets for low-latency access.

User Authentication:
Users register and log in through the frontend, which interacts with Amazon Cognito.
Cognito manages user pools and handles authentication flows.

API Requests:
Authenticated users interact with the backend through RESTful APIs exposed by Amazon API Gateway.
API Gateway routes requests to corresponding AWS Lambda functions.

Backend Logic:
AWS Lambda functions handle core backend logic, including user management, image upload, and retrieval.
Lambda functions interact with Amazon RDS (Aurora) for user data and metadata storage.

Image Storage:
Uploaded images are stored in a separate Amazon S3 bucket.
Image URLs are stored in the database and referenced by users.

Security:
AWS WAF and AWS Shield protect the application from web exploits and DDoS attacks.
IAM roles and policies ensure secure access to AWS resources.
